# Social Network Analysis Proof of Concept

## Overview

This project is an early-stage, proof-of-concept social network analysis tool built in Python.  
You can add users, create connections, store profiles, measure user influence, and explore the network—just like a mini version of Twitter or LinkedIn, but for learning and experimenting.

## Code and Report Files

- **`social_network.py`**  
  The main Python implementation.  
  - Add users and connections
  - Store/retrieve user profiles
  - Find top influencers (by number of connections)
  - Explore the network with breadth-first search (BFS)
  - All code is clearly commented for learning and future expansion.


- **`deliverable-2-report.docx`** 
  Your project report: explains design, demonstration, challenges, and next steps.

## ▶️ How to Run
